                    <p>I have always had an interest in computer programming but it is only recently, at the age of 32, that I became fully commited to following programming as a career. I decided that web design would be the best path to take initially; my plan is to proceed onto software programming as well at some point. To learn the basics I enrolled on a few online courses but most of my learning has taken place through figuring things out as I go along.<p>I work as a Work Area Manager at Royal Mail which is a full time job, I have a young daughter and am currently renovating a house with my partner so fitting things in can be quite a struggle! As such, I am being realistic about the projects I can take on.</p><p>The purpose of this site is to build up a portfolio of work through creating websites for small businesses. Please have a look at the services we provide on our services page</p><button type="button" class="pull-right btn btn-lg btn-custom">Our services.</button>
