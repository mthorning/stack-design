To learn the basics I enrolled on a few online courses but most of my learning has taken place through figuring things out as I go along.</p><p>I work as a Work Area Manager at Royal Mail which is a full time job, I have a young daughter and I am currently renovating a house with my partner so fitting things in can be quite a struggle! As such, I am being realistic about the projects I can take on.</p>"

The client area allows my customers to see the latest changes to their developing sites, message me with any comments or changes they would like to see and upload files for inclusion.</p><p>With very little in the way of overheads and keeping in mind that the work I do will serve me in the future as an example of my capabilities to future employers, I intend to keep my the costs for my services as low as possible.</p><p>It is vitally important with something such as computer programming that I <cite>keep my eye in</cite> so that I do not lose the skills I have learnt. Stack-Design serves this purpose, I experiment with unfamiliar technologies on my on site and then apply my skills when creating sites for businesses who contact me with the desire to get themselves online.</p>"
